# Tremola-Development: virtual backend for the Chrome Browser

Rationale: instead of writing JS and HTML code for your app, compile
in Android and then test it, this "tremola4chrome" environment enables
you to run it inside a Chrome brower tab.

Using Chrome's broadcast feature between tabs, new log entries are
sent to all tabs where they are funneled to your JS app logic. See the
attached PDF for details (parts in German).
